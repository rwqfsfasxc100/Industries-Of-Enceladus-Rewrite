SYSTEM_HULLVAT_AMMO_1|Mounted Ammunition Canister

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_AMMO_1_DESC|A lightweight magazine traditionally used to provide extra magazine space for Vilcy vessels utilizing the lesser-used hallways of the vessel. Despite being installed as a secondary system, it still had to make use of the ammunition delivery hatch to bring ammo to the hardpoints, restricting delivery speed to that of the currently installed magazine. The infringement of the air vents caused by various mechanisms used to feed the magazine cause a minor "stuffiness" reported by crews, who may find vessels fitted with them uncomfortable after a longer period of time.
