SYSTEM_HULLVAT_AMMO_1|MPI Mounted Ammunition Canister

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_AMMO_1_DESC|A lightweight magazine traditionally used to provide extra magazine space for Vilcy vessels utilizing the lesser-used hallways of the vessel. Despite being installed as a secondary system, it still had to make use of the ammunition delivery hatch to bring ammo to the hardpoints, restricting delivery speed to that of the currently installed magazine. The infringement of the air vents caused by various mechanisms used to feed the magazine cause a minor "stuffiness" reported by crews, who may find vessels fitted with them uncomfortable after a longer period of time.

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_AMMO_2|ND Hollowed Hull Ammunition Magazine

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_AMMO_2_DESC|Originally based on smuggling mechanisms used during conflicts, the ND HHAM (frequently nicknamed by industry insiders the "Ham") makes use of spare space within the ship's hull alongside a large portion of the nanodrone cartridge space to fit in a whopping 15 tonnes of extra mass driver ammunition. Although commonly reserved for Vilcy-licensed specialists, the Ham made it's way onto the civillian market due to a recent reduction in required licensing to allow for those who suffer from a trigger finger to mine without as much issue, without causing Kessler syndrome in the process.

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_AMMO_EXTEND_1|Antonoff Ammunition Expansion Kit

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_AMMO_EXTEND_1_DESC|This kit makes use of processed storage space to store additional projectiles based on currently installed kits. Due to Enceladus's current equipment labelling laws, reduction percentages will be equivalent regardless of vessels, leading to potentially lost space among many vessels. This however will benefit vessels with smaller internal holds or larger magazine capacities, with smaller losses or larger gains from the laws.

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_AMMO_EXTEND_3|Obonto Projectile Extendo+

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_AMMO_EXTEND_3_DESC|Using a different approach to earlier tech for extending the mass driver magazine, instead opting to sacrifice a portion of the propellant tank. Due to conflicting Enceladian laws, it abides by a 1-size-fits-all approach to the tank reduction percent, but will always ensure that 10 tonnes of propellant is available, even if it means that propellant has to be stored in the same container as the ammunition.

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_NANO_1|Runasimi Drone Component Vat

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_NANO_1_DESC|Like a large number of Runasimi's commercial products, the DCV focuses on providing a small boost in the available nanodrone components. Originally designed as a backup compartment only available during emergencies, later models were unlocked to allow their contents to be used during nominal flight.

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_NANO_1_SPECS|Drone part capacity: 6,000 kg \nAmmunition magazine loss: 25% \nDry mass: 4,500 kg \nManufacturer: Runasimi

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_NANO_2|Runasimi Hull-Fitted Nanodrone Locker

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_NANO_2_DESC|Based off of the success of the DCV, a larger unit was put into production to allow nanodrone-heavy users able to make good use of the often-unused mass driver magazine space to fit a considerably large portion of nanodrones. The lack of any dedicated safety units allowed for a greater parts-to-magazine space ratio than previous designs.

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_NANO_EXTEND_1|Antonoff Nano Storage Expansion

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_NANO_EXTEND_1_DESC|Based along a similar design to the ammunition line of extension retrofit kits, this modification exchanges a portion of the mineral hold to allow for more nanodrone parts to be stored within the vessel. Note that the same laws apply to these kits, and storage adjustment margins are fixed to what is labeled regardless of vessel.

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_NANO_EXTEND_3|Obonto Liquid Nanobot Hold

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_NANO_EXTEND_3_DESC|The nanodrone storage variation of Obonto's Projectile Extendo+, this kit replaces a decently sized portion of the propellant tank to store additional nanodrone components. This variant is surprisingly popular among construction crews despite the hit to their propellant storage, likely due to the recent laxing of rulings against tug and haul nanodrone mounts from being used during ring construction.

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_CONSUMABLESPEED_1|Tetsuo SCARLETTE Delivery Driver

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_CONSUMABLESPEED_1_DESC|The SCARLETTE driver is a module designed to rework the way consumables are provided to the hardpoints. Originally used for military applications, the SCARLETTE was rebranded as an industrial modification after contracts with Nakamura Dynamics were terminated. Despite being used primarily for industrial grade mass driver units, some captains with particularly heavy mass driver requirements were able to make exceptional use of this module.

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_CONSUMABLESPEED_1_SPECS|Consumable storage delivery speed: +75% \nDry mass: 3,800 kg \nManufacturer: Tetsuo Engineering

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_CONSUMABLESPEED_MANUAL|Speeds up the delivery speed of applicable consumable storages by a percentage. \nBest if used in conjunction with industrial-grade equipment. 


SYSTEM_HULLVAT_CONSUMABLESPEED_2|Tetsuo RamDrive Consumable Delivery Efficiency Module

SYSTEM_HULLVAT_CONSUMABLESPEED_2_DESC|In conjunction with the consumer market release of their industrial-grade mass driver, the Tetsuo HMX 2000l, a previously industry-insider only module was made available to consumers looking to retrofit their vessels to be able to make use of it, especially for crews unable to make use of it's iron delivery system or could not afford a vessel capable of meeting it's requirements, this module makes heavy adjustments to the delivery systems of a vessel, and as a result can be used to retrofit a majority of magazines to be able to meet the HMX's absurd ammunition delivery requirements.
