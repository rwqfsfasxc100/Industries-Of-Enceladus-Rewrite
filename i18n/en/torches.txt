SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_NANI|SSE NANI Torch Refit

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_NANI_DESC|This comically impractical and completely disgusting main torch is the ultimate logical conclusion of many a night spent drinking and ruminating on life's purpose. Coming to the determination that there isn't one, the team at Sin Space Engineering put their heads together and produced this thing. \n\nDisclaimer: Omaewamou-Shindeiru thinks this is really funny and fully endorses the NANI's use as a propulsion solution. May void vessel warranty. Usage as main torch in some vessels may damage your reactor. Have fun!

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_GEMINI|MA-NTR600-II dual engine

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_GEMINI_DESC|The NTR600-II, otherwise known as the "Gemini", is a dual-mounted magnetoplasmadynamic torch unit capable of delivering decent thrust with excellent efficiency and reliability. The dual exhaust layout in combination of a basic thrust vectoring system also allows for additional virtual vectoring, furthering the potential efficiency of the torch. \n\nDisclaimer: maintenance of this unit is to be performed only by Mitsudaya-Starbus engineers or licensed sub-contractors. Insurance plans are not yet available in the outer solar system.

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_SOYUZ|RA-TNTRL-R44 quad engine

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_SOYUZ_DESC|It's by no stretch of the imagination that this "torch" exists. Rusatom-Antonoff aimed to compete with other multiple-torch assemblies by introducing their own, but development was slow, and by the end of the 22nd century, many prototypes had been tried and failed with no viable solutions. \n\nMyths of its invention process vary, but generally suggest that the lead designer on the project was visited in a dream by the ghost of legendary Soviet rocket engineer Valentin Glushko. He spoke one word, 'Soyuz', and then departed, leaving the K44 RCS thruster at the designer's feet. \n\nProduction of these combined units continues to this day, and is part of the reason why the K44 thruster is still so abundant.

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_SOYUZ_SPECS|Thrust: 1,600 kN \nExhaust velocity: 15 km/s \nPropellant consumption: 106.4 kg/s \nPower consumption: 60 MW \nThermal consumption: 12.0 GW \nOperation mode: Pulsed thrust \nPropellant: Oxygen-Hydrogen plasma \nMass: 650 kg \nManufacturer: Rusatom-Antonoff



SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_THUNDER|RA-K69V quad engine

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_THUNDER_DESC|This torch is a custom-engineered piece of equipment that takes the frame of an R44 and replaces its engines with K69V thrusters, complete with the gimbal mountings the line is so famous for among ringside racers. Installation comes with optional and entirely legal "Thunderbarge-class" transponder modification. Personal grappling hook available on special request.

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_THUNDER_SPECS|Thrust: 1,600 kN \nExhaust velocity: 12 km/s \nPropellant consumption: 133.2 kg/s \nPower consumption: 100 MW \nThermal consumption: 14.4 GW \nGimbal angle: 25 deg \nGimbal speed: 360 deg/s \nOperation mode: Pulsed thrust, gimballed \nPropellant: Oxygen-Hydrogen plasma \nMass: 950 kg \nManufacturer: Custom-built / Rusatom-Antonoff



SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_PIN1200|RMS Pin-M200 engine

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_PIN1200_DESC|The Rasamama Material Solutions Pin-M200 implements the same pulsed induction technology that powers its Pin-150 series of solid-state RCS thrusters on a larger scale. The upscaling of the tech does make for a more fragile thruster, however it is still well within the bounds of competitor's reliability data. \n\nThe sheer thermal power of the upscaled technology posed a nominal burn requirement of well over 60 GW direct from the reactor. Considering that it outpaces even racing reactors, it was decided to include a micro fusion reactor for the power supply. Unlike equivalent fusion torches, this reactor is used solely for the purpose of providing heat, rather than being essential to the generation of thrust, the ignition of which causes an extra 100 MW of electrical power to ignite the core, and a limited tank of fusion fuel limiting burn time to roughly an hour and a half.

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_PIN1200_SPECS|Thrust: 1,200 kN \nExhaust velocity: 105 km/s \nPropellant consumption: 11.4 kg/s \nPower consumption: 510 MW \nVectoring angle: 22.5 deg \nVectoring speed: 28 deg/s \nOperation mode: Variable thrust \nPropellant: Hydrogen plasma / uranium salt \nBurn time: 90 minutes (est) \nMass: 11,350 kg \nManufacturer: Rasamama Material Solutions



SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_CRACK|NDDFD engine

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_CRACK_DESC|The Directed Fusion Detonation engine by Nakamura Dynamics is one of the most powerful - and earliest! - fusion propulsion solutions still on the market. Popularised by a now-infamous 2214 advertisement backed by the Vengaboys' "Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom", the NDDFD utilises powerful electromagnets to crush remass-heated ferromagnetic shells containing pressurised deuterium and tritium, then direct the resultant detonation out of its cage-like nozzle assembly. \n\nUnlike its competitor, the NDDFD requires a enormous and continuous supply of power to maintain propulsion, and its relatively large pellets and specialised feed hardware dramatically limits its fuel capacity in small vessels.

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_CRACK_SPECS|Thrust: 1,800 kN \nExhaust velocity: 1,850 km/s \nPropellant consumption: 1 kg/s \nPower consumption: 445 MW \nOperation mode: Pulsed thrust \n Propellant: Hydrogen plasma \nFusion fuel: D-T \nBurn time: 30 minutes (est) \nMass: 4,650 kg \nManufacturer: Nakamura Dynamics



SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_ZURBIN|ND ZURBIN engine

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_ZURBIN_DESC|The Zurbin engine is the high-performance main engine of the Tsukuyuomi class of frigates. Now decomissioned, these engines see use still aboard the frigates, albeit long gone from the days of combat involvement. Nakamura Dynamics did make a push to reuse any from scrapped frigates, putting them to use in their Phage class of autonomous stations.

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_ZURBIN_SPECS|Thrust: 6,900 kN \nExhaust velocity: 66 km/s \nPropellant consumption: 104.5 kg/s \nPower consumption: 50 MW \nOperation mode: Variable thrust \nPropellant: Oxygen-Hydrogen plasma \nMass: 10,000 kg \nManufacturer: Nakamura Dynamics



SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_PMS|ND PMS engine

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_PMS_DESC|The PMS is an early predecessor to the NTTR thruster. Nakamura Dynamics's first large NTR type thruster holds an abysmal propellant economy and sub-par thrust for a raw NTR, it still holds out for it's sheer reliability. Able to operate under stresses far-exceeding any other thruster on the market, and being incredibly sturdy for it's power, the PMS still keeps up with demand for a thruster able to keep running, even in situations that would be considered dire using alternatives.

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_PMS_SPECS|Thrust: 3,000 kN \nExhaust velocity: 3 km/s \nPropellant consumption: 1000 kg/s \nPower consumption: 20 MW \nThermal consumption: 4.5 GW \nOperation mode: Variable thrust \nPropellant: Oxygen-Hydrogen plasma \nMass: 250 kg \nManufacturer: Nakamura Dynamics
